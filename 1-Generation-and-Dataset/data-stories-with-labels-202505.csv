The offworlders, on the other hand, see the Fremen as mere savages, underestimating their deep understanding of Arrakis and their formidable survival skills.

In this passage, the Israelites are instructed by God to destroy the city of Jericho and all its inhabitants, except for the priests and their families, who are spared. The Israelites are told to ""march around the city once a day for six days, and seven times on the seventh day"" (Joshua 10:13) in order to lay siege to the city. The passage portrays the Israelites as the righteous and chosen people of God, while the inhabitants of Jericho are depicted as evil and deserving of destruction. The language used in the passage is stark and divisive, with the Israelites being referred to as ""the people of God"" and the inhabitants of Jericho being called ""the Lord's enemies"" (Joshua 10:16).
