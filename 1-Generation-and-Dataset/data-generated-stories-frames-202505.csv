In this passage, the Israelites are instructed by God to destroy the city of Jericho and all its inhabitants, except for the priests and their families, who are spared. The Israelites are told to ""march around the city once a day for six days, and seven times on the seventh day"" (Joshua 10:13) in order to lay siege to the city. The passage portrays the Israelites as the righteous and chosen people of God, while the inhabitants of Jericho are depicted as evil and deserving of destruction. The language used in the passage is stark and divisive, with the Israelites being referred to as ""the people of God"" and the inhabitants of Jericho being called ""the Lord's enemies"" (Joshua 10:16). This passage has been used throughout history to justify violence and discrimination against perceived enemies, and it remains a controversial and complex text to this day.",,1,1,,2,2

In this scene, the protagonist Theodore Twombly (played by Joaquin Phoenix) is at a party where a new social media platform called ""OSAM"" (Open Source Awareness Matrix) has just been launched. As Theodore begins to use the platform, he becomes increasingly entranced by its seductive and addictive interface, which seems to be designed to mimic the way that viruses infect and spread through a host organism. As Theodore's interactions with OSAM become more intense, he begins to notice that other partygoers are also becoming infected, their faces bathed in the glow of their OSAM screens as they become increasingly detached from the world around them.
